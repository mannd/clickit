Clickit README
==============

Clickit's only task is to generate keystrokes to sign documents automatically.  It uses a script written in the [AutoIt scripting language](http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/index.shtml).

Installation
------------

Please read the file INSTALL.txt.  After installation and testing return to these instructions.

Using with Allscripts
---------------------

Go to your documents page.  IMPORTANT: Sign the first one yourself, manually, as you have to enter your password the first time.  After that, leaving the Allscripts browser window open, double click on clickit.bat on your desktop, and then go away and have a cup of coffee.  The program will sign about 20 documents, then stop.  If there are more to sign, just double click clickit.bat again.  If all are signed and the clickit.bat window (an old-fashioned back dos window) is still open right-click on the Scriptit task in the taskbar and select Terminate.  IMPORTANT: Always end the program before going to any other Allscripts page, as the program will continue to generate keystrokes, possibly doing things you don't want in Allscripts.

Using with Sovera
-----------------

Bring up you're documents that need to be signed.  Sign the first one.  This will bring up the password dialog.  Fill in the password, then double click on clickitsovera on your desktop.  Now sit back and relax or do something more useful than clicking on a computer screen.  The signing is all automatic!

Stopping Clickit
----------------

If there are too many signatures so that Clickit stops before you are done signing, just restart it.  If the signatures end before Clickit does, you will hear some annoying beeps.  To stop Clickit, just right-click on the Windows taskbar where is says "Scriptit" and close/terminate.

Harm Done
---------

Be careful that you don't sign things that you should be reviewing first.  Realize that even if everything looks like it can be signed automatically when you start Clickit, it is possible that an item that is flagged will show up while Clickit is running.  It is probably best to run Clickit at off-hours when this is unlikely to happen, or to watch your screen when Clickit is running.  We don't take responsibility for errors in signing from Clickit -- if you are worried about that, don't run Clickit!
