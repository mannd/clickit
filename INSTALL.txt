Clickit Installation

Download the zip file and unzip it anywhere you want, e.g. your
Desktop or your Documents folder.  You must have write permission for
the folder in which you unzip Clickit.  Open the Clickit folder that
you unzipped (make sure you unzip it first).  Right-click on the
clickit.exe file (and optionally on the clickitallscripts.exe and
clickitsovera.exe files if you want to use the built-in scripts for
these EMR systems) and select "Send To" and then
"Desktop (create shortcut)" from the menu that appears.  You can
double-click on this shortcut to start Clickit.  See the README file
for general instructions on using Clickit.
