Version 0.5 update
	Install into and run from any directory.

Version 0.4 update
	Added sovera.ini script to allow automatic signing of Sovera documents.

Version 0.3 update
	Added separate Vista and XP allscripts.ini files.  Vista titles IE windows as "Windows Internet Explorer" and XP uses "Microsoft Internet Explorer."

Version 0.2 update
	The actual scriptit.exe file was left out of the 0.1 zip file, rendering it useless.  Also fixed the allscripts.ini file and increased the number of Alt-S keystrokes generated.
